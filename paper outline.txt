Abstract:
Introduction:
AdjScaling
    What
    Why

Desired Applications:
Machine translation
Pedagogical resources
Cultural linguistic comparisons



Methodology:
Corpus
    Japanese Internet corpus by Kyoto University
    Encoding issues
    Trimming heuristics
Induce patterns
    Techniques
    Problems
    Differences with English
    Attempted solutions/heuristics
Use patterns with words to find orderings
    General technique

Problems/differences with English
   
Use orderings and logic to make scale
    No need to know which side of pattern was “stronger” or “weaker”, just build along a consistent direction

Considerations:
Parallel scales that differ along different traits such as formality, what they can modify, etc.
Corpus being mostly written so written speech bias
Confidence in a pair
